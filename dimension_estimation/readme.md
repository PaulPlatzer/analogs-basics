Simple examples of estimating the local dimension of datasets from analogs.

This local dimension is informative of the number of degrees of freedom of a system, it can help you decide how to perform dimension reduction if you want to, or give information about the probability distributions of analog-to-target distances.

For more details see Platzer et al., 2021, Probability Distributions for Analog-to-Target Distances, Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences.
